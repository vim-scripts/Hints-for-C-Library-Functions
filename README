This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1825

This script may be manually sourced or, if placed in .vim/ftplugin/c, will be automatically sourced whenever a C file is edited (which is where vimball will put it).  The prototypes within it are based on gcc's /usr/share/man/man2 directory.

This plugin is truly simple to use: after one has typed a function name, a protype "hint" will be shown.
 
ex.    select(

       will result in

          int select(int nfds, fd_set * readfds, fd_set * writefds, fd_set * exceptfds, struct timeval * utimeout)

       being echo'd at the bottom of the display.

You'll probably want your cmdheight option set to at least two (ie.  set ch=2). 

(see vimscript#1826 for man-3 based function hints)
